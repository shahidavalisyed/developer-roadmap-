- Databases (SQL joins, indexes, transactions)

**Projects (small but polished):**
- Task Manager (CRUD + auth + DB)
- Notes App (React + REST API + PostgreSQL)
- Chat App (WebSockets + Redis Pub/Sub)

âœ… **End of Year 1:** Youâ€™re like a 2â€“3 years experienced dev already.

## ðŸ“… Year 2 â€“ Applied Software Engineering
**Goal:** Master building scalable apps.

**Frameworks:**
- Java â†’ Spring Boot
- TypeScript â†’ Node.js + NestJS

**Architecture:**
- Monolith vs Microservices
- REST, gRPC, GraphQL
- Event-driven architecture (Kafka basics)

**DevOps:**
- Git, Docker, CI/CD
- Deploy on AWS/GCP

**Projects:**
- E-commerce backend (cart, payments, orders, inventory)
- Notification Service (email, SMS, push, webhooks)
- Deploy on Kubernetes

âœ… **End of Year 2:** Youâ€™re at mid-level engineer (5+ years exp) skill.

## ðŸ“… Year 3 â€“ Systems & Scaling
**Goal:** Deep dive into distributed systems & system design.

**Advanced DSA:**
- Graphs, DP, advanced trees

**System Design:**
- CAP theorem, sharding, partitioning, consistency models
- High availability, caching, load balancing
- Study FAANG design interview questions

**Databases:**
- SQL optimization (query plans, indexes)
- NoSQL (Mongo, Cassandra, Redis, Elastic)
- Time-series + Vector DB

**Infra:**
- Kubernetes advanced (service mesh, Helm, autoscaling)
- Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)

**Projects:**
- Uber-like app (real-time tracking, matching, surge pricing)
- Slack clone (chat + file sharing + notifications)
- Recommendation Engine (ML-lite, collaborative filtering)

âœ… **End of Year 3:** You think like a senior engineer (8â€“10 years exp).

---

## ðŸ“… Year 4 â€“ Architecture Mastery & Leadership
**Goal:** Lead projects, make trade-offs, think like an architect.

**Distributed Systems:**
- Consensus (Raft, Paxos), event sourcing, CQRS
- API gateways, service mesh

**Security:**
- OAuth2, SAML, RBAC, multi-tenancy
- GDPR, SOC2 basics

**Scaling Patterns:** Circuit breakers, retries, bulkheads

**DevOps Advanced:** Terraform, GitOps, chaos engineering

**Projects:**
- Multi-tenant SaaS CRM (like HubSpot-lite)
- Video streaming platform (YouTube-lite with CDN + scaling)
- Lead open-source contributions

âœ… **End of Year 4:** Youâ€™re like a staff engineer (12â€“15 years exp).

---

## ðŸ“… Year 5 â€“ The CTO Mindset
**Goal:** Combine tech + product + business sense.

**Tech Strategy:**
- Cost optimization, vendor lock-in, infra trade-offs

**Business Acumen:**

**Team Leadership:**
- Mentoring, code reviews, architecture reviews

**Soft Skills:**
- Design docs, clear communication, negotiation

**Projects:**
- Build & launch your own SaaS product
- Handle real customers + scaling + support
- Mentor juniors or run a dev community

âœ… **End of Year 5:** You can lead a tech startup as CTO or operate like a 20-year experienced engineer.
