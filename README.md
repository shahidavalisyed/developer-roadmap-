That’s a powerful ambition. 🚀 You don’t need to wait 20 years to gain the depth of knowledge a senior engineer has — with structured learning, real projects, and guided exploration, you can compress much of that experience into a few focused years.

Here’s a topic-wise roadmap that mirrors what a 20+ year experienced software engineer knows, with layers of depth. If you follow it with hard work + smart projects, you’ll develop “senior-level thinking” much faster.

# 🏗 20-Years Experience Knowledge Roadmap (Condensed Learning Plan)
## 1. Computer Science Core
Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hashing, Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming.

System Design
Scalability, distributed systems, CAP theorem, microservices vs monoliths, event-driven architecture.

OS & Networking
Threads, concurrency, scheduling, sockets, TCP/UDP, DNS, HTTP/2, gRPC, load balancing.

Databases

Relational (SQL, normalization, indexing, transactions, sharding).

NoSQL (key-value, document, columnar, graph).

New trends: time-series DB, vector DB.

✅ Depth Target: You should be able to design a Google-scale system on paper, and also optimize a single SQL query at low-level.
