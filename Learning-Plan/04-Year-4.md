# 📅 Year 4 Plan (Tech Lead / Staff Engineer Path)

---

## 🔹 Q1 (Months 37–39): Large-Scale System Design Mastery

### Advanced System Design
- Global-scale architecture (multi-region, multi-cloud).  
- Distributed consensus: Raft, Paxos, Zookeeper.  
- Strong vs eventual consistency trade-offs.  

### Data Engineering & Streaming
- Apache Kafka (exactly-once semantics, stream processing).  
- Apache Flink / Spark Streaming.  
- Real-time analytics pipelines.  

**Mini Project**  
🚖 **Ride-Sharing Platform (Uber-lite)**  
- Real-time location tracking with Kafka.  
- Matching algorithm for riders/drivers.  
- Multi-region deployment simulation.

## 🔹 Q2 (Months 40–42): Architectural Patterns & Enterprise Systems

### Architecture Patterns
- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters).  
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD).  
- Event-driven & reactive systems.  

### Enterprise Systems
- ERP/CRM concepts.  
- Integrations with legacy systems (SOAP, ESB).  

### Scalability Practices
- API rate limiting, throttling.  
- Feature flags, blue-green deployments.  

**Mini Project**  
💼 **Enterprise CRM**  
- Modular architecture with DDD.  
- Support for multiple integrations.

## 🔹 Q3 (Months 43–45): DevOps & Reliability Engineering

### DevOps at Scale
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD).  
- Canary deployments, chaos engineering (Gremlin, Chaos Monkey).  

### Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- SLAs, SLOs, SLIs.  
- Error budgets, toil reduction.  

### Resilience Patterns
- Leader election, quorum-based writes.  
- Failover strategies (active-active, active-passive).  

**Mini Project**  
🛒 **Global E-commerce Platform**  
- Active-active deployment across 2 regions.  
- Observability with SLO dashboards.  

---

## 🔹 Q4 (Months 46–48): Leadership & Scaling Teams

### Tech Leadership
- Running design reviews, RFCs.  
- Hiring engineers, interviewing.  
- Mentorship frameworks.  

### Project Management
- Agile at scale (Scrum of Scrums, SAFe).  
- Cross-team collaboration.  

### Engineering Excellence
- Writing internal tooling/libraries for teams.  
- Building shared services platform.  

**Capstone Project**  
🌐 **Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform**  
- Central auth, billing, monitoring.  
- Pluggable module design.  
- Multi-tenant data isolation (schema-per-tenant vs shared schema).
